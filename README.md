# COFLASY-M: COsmological evolution of FLAvour ASYmmetries - Mathematica

The Mathematica code "COFLASY-M" has been developed by Valerie Domcke, Miguel Escudero, Mario Fernandez Navarro and Stefan Sandner in order to study the evolution of primordial lepton flavour asymmetries from the early Universe to BBN, following the approach of arXiv:2502.XXXXXX. If you use this code for scientific publications, please cite this paper:

As of 21/02/2025:

The github repository of this code consists of the following files:

BasicModule.m: contains all the definitions, equations and functions used to solve the system of differential equations and produce output.

COFLASY-M.nb: acts as the main front end notebook which loads BasicModule.m and contains a series of
examples that serve as a tutorial for the user. These examples refer to some of the evolution plots in arXiv:2502.XXXXXX.

COFLASY-M.pdf: technical notes written in latex which contain a description of the full set of equations, definitions and functions that form the code.


To get started, we advise the user to read the technical notes. In order to run the code, the user may open the COFLADSY-M.nb notebook and evaluate the "Basic module" section. Afterwards, the user may go through the "Examples" section in the COFLADSY-M.nb notebook, which serves as a tutorial to get familiar with the code.
